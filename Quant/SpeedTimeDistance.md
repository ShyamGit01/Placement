# Formulas of Speed, Time and Distance

Distance = Speed x Time

Speed =		Distance / Time

Time =		Distance / Speed


### Formula for Conversion of Km/hr to m/sec where x is in Km/hr

1 km = 1000m

1 h = 3600 s

So 1km /h = 1000/3600 =  5/18

Y m/sec =		X *	(5/18)		m/sec

Formula for Conversion of m/sec to Km/hr where x is in m/sec

1 m =\frac{1}{1000} \

Equal Distance at two speeds
An object covers equal distance  at speed S1 and other equal distance at speed S2 then his average speed for the distance is (2S1S2)/(S1 + S2)

Formula for speed, time and distance
Train based Formulas of Speed, Time and Distance-
ST  = Speed of Train
SO  = Speed of Object
LT  = Length of Train
LO  = Length of Object
Formula PrepInsta
Case 1 –
When Train Crosses a Stationary Object with no Length(e.g. Pole) in time t

ST =  \frac{L_T}{t} \  
t

Case 2 –
When Train Crosses a Stationary Object with Length LO (e.g. Train Platform) in time t

ST = (LT +LO) / t
Formula PrepInsta
Case 3 –
When Train Crosses a Moving Object with no Length (e.g. Car has negligible length) in time t

Objects moving in Opposite directions
(ST + SO) = LT/ t
Objects moving in Same directions
(ST – SO) = LT/ t
Formula PrepInsta
Case 3 –
When Train Crosses a Moving Object with no Length (e.g. Car has negligible length) in time t

Objects moving in Opposite directions
(ST + SO) = LT/ t
Objects moving in Same directions
(ST – SO) = LT/ t
Formula PrepInsta
Case 4 –
When Train Crosses a Moving Object with Length LO (e.g. Another Train treated as an object) in time t

Objects(Trains) moving in Opposite directions
(ST + SO) = (LT +LO)/ t
Objects(Trains) moving in Same directions
(ST – SO) = (LT +LO)/ t
Note – In Case for Train 2 is treated as an object
